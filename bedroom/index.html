    <img src="nightobjectsalt.png" alt="It's a pitch, black bedroom in the middle of the night. On the right is a bed with a nightstand and lamp. On the far right, a doorway.">
    <img src="maincharacteralt.png" alt="In the bed lies, someone. They look away from the doorway, toward the ground in front of the nightstand. They move rhythmically as they breathe, though it might just be fear.">
    <img src="messagealt.png" alt="There's a quivering line of text beneath the scene, for you and for the someone in the bed, that reads 'turn on the light' in all lowercase.">
    <img src="hoverlampalt.png" alt="Obeying the text, you can hover your cursor over the lamp.">
    <img src="figurealt.png" alt="As if consequence, a figure appears in the doorway.">
    <img src="wanderingeyesalt.png" alt="The someone in bed senses the presence, and without moving their body they gaze from their periphery toward the doorway.">
    <img src="lightobjectsalt.png" alt="Swiftly, they (aka by you holding down the cursor on the lamp) turn on the lamp. The room is white with light. They sit up and look toward the doorway. There's nothing there. All there's left to do is try and go back to sleep. But as soon as the room goes black again, the cycle repeats.">
